      <description>Introduction In this short guide I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you how to add support to Radare2 for EVM ASM (Ethereum Virtual Machine Assembly) so you can start reverse engineering Ethereum smart contracts. This guide is written specifically with Ubuntu Bionic in mind so package names / package managers for other Linux flavors will differ.
Requirements  Ubuntu server or desktop is fine. sudo or root access  Installing Radare2 + The EVM Plugin It is always recommended to install Radare2 from Git instead of using your package manager as Radare2 is updated very quickly.</description>

      <description>Introduction Today we are going to look at how I solved the BOB Boot2Root from C0rruptedb1t / Vulnhub. This is a fairly simple challenge as far as skill goes but it requires strong logic and problem solving skills. You really need to think outside the box with this one. I have chosen the VM from the c0rruptedb1t website as it appears to be the most up to date version.</description>

      <description>Introduction Today we are going to look at how I solved the Pinky&amp;rsquo;s Palace V1 Boot2Root from VulnHub. I really enjoyed this box and would recommend it for anyone who wants to practice common exploitation methods.
VM Info Name: Pinky&amp;rsquo;s Palace V1
Author: @Pink_P4nther
Link: https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/pinkys-palace-v1,225
Difficulty: Beginner / Intermediate
Networking: Auto DHCP (192.168.1.45)
Discovery We begin our journey with a port scan. The VM tells us it&amp;rsquo;s IP on boot so we don&amp;rsquo;t need to go and scan our own network to find the host, in my case the IP is 192.</description>

      <description>Introduction I hope this article can give you a basic introduction to the world of &amp;lsquo;breach hunting&amp;rsquo; something I have recently come to enjoy (wierd right?). This is by no means an exhaustive list of tools and methodologies but more a primer to get you going in the exhilarating world of spending hours trawling through other peoples lists, spreadsheets and datasets for the greater good.
Searching With all the different methods I find it is more manageable to split my searches by country.</description>

      <description>Introduction Today CloudFlare launched 1.1.1.1, a new consumer DNS resolver that promises to respect your privacy, it also supports DNS over HTTPS! I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of Pi-Hole which I use to block tracking, advertisements etc across my whole network but unfortunately Pi-Hole does not yet support DNS over HTTPS. Lucky for us CloudFlare have released a https proxy which we can use while we wait for Pi-Hole to catch up.</description>

      <description>Introduction If you have not been living in a dark disconnected cave for the past year, you may have noticed the growing trend of abusing badly configured Amazon s3 buckets for fun and profit. Using tools like Bucket Stream and Teh S3 Bucketeers for a short time you&amp;rsquo;ll see how bad the situation really is.
Check Your Bucket ACL and Bucket Policy You can check your bucket ACL using the folowing command ( more info on AWS CLI )</description>
