      <description>Introduction Today we are going to look at how I solved the BOB Boot2Root from C0rruptedb1t / Vulnhub. This is a fairly simple challenge as far as skill goes but it requires strong logic and problem solving skills. You really need to think outside the box with this one. I have chosen the VM from the c0rruptedb1t website as it appears to be the most up to date version.</description>

      <description>Introduction Today we are going to look at how I solved the Pinky&amp;rsquo;s Palace V1 Boot2Root from VulnHub. I really enjoyed this box and would recommend it for anyone who wants to practice common exploitation methods.
VM Info Name: Pinky&amp;rsquo;s Palace V1
Author: @Pink_P4nther
Link: https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/pinkys-palace-v1,225
Difficulty: Beginner / Intermediate
Networking: Auto DHCP (192.168.1.45)
Discovery We begin our journey with a port scan. The VM tells us it&amp;rsquo;s IP on boot so we don&amp;rsquo;t need to go and scan our own network to find the host, in my case the IP is 192.</description>
